# Climate Risk and Vulnerability Analysis using Machine Learning

This project aims to assess climate risks and vulnerabilities using machine learning (ML) techniques. By analyzing climate data such as temperature, precipitation, and other environmental factors, the goal is to identify patterns and predict areas of high vulnerability to climate-related risks.

## Project Overview

Climate change poses significant threats to communities, economies, and ecosystems globally. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of climate variables and socio-economic factors to identify regions at risk and vulnerable to climate impacts such as floods, droughts, and extreme weather events.

The machine learning models developed in this project will help to:

- Identify climate risk hotspots.
- Assess vulnerabilities of different regions based on socio-economic and environmental factors.
- Predict future climate-related risks and impacts.
  
## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering from diverse climate datasets (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.).
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key climate risk factors.
- Classification and regression models to predict risk levels.
- Visualization of risk assessment results on maps and graphs.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: 
   - Collect and preprocess climate and socio-economic data.
   - Handle missing values, normalization, and encoding.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Visualize climate patterns, trends, and anomalies.
   - Identify key variables influencing climate risk.

3. **Model Training & Prediction**: 
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks) to predict regions' vulnerability to climate risks.

4. **Risk Visualization**:
   - Display results on interactive maps using geopandas or folium.
   - Generate risk heatmaps to show the severity of climate impacts across regions.

## Evaluation

Models will be evaluated using various performance metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve and AUC score
